# Bank Loan Behavior Modeling Analysis
## Background
Lending interest is one of the main sources of income for banks. Banks usually hope to expand the base of borrowers to bring more loan business and interest income. Therefore, in response to such needs, banks usually try to build various models to help them identify potential users with higher loan possibilities. By correlating an individual's borrowing behavior with their own economic situation, banks can often draw conclusions. A certain degree of regularity and useful information to achieve their goals, find individuals who are likely to make loans, and achieve precise marketing and lending. In this data mining practice task, I used this type of model as the research object. I selected the bank data set for correlation analysis, learning and prediction, and obtained the intrinsic relationship between the features of the data set. I also analyzed and predicted the features with the highest correlation with loan behavior.
